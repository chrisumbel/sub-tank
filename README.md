# sub-tank

This is a small embedded C project targeted at the pic18f2550 microcontroller
for an autonomous, ultrasonic-guided toy tank.  The ultrasonic sensor is 
intended to be on an arm actuated by a servo allowing the system to get an idea
of what obstacles are in a 180-degree-ish range of the front of the robot.

A detailed blog post including some details about the physical construction
should arrive at some point in July or early August of 2016.
